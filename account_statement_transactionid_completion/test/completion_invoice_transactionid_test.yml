  In order to test the banking framework, I first need to create a profile
-
  !record {model: account.statement.profile, id: statement_profile_invoice_transactionid}:
    name: Bank EUR Profile (invoice transaction ID)
    journal_id: account.bank_journal
    commission_account_id: account.a_expense
    company_id: base.main_company
    balance_check: True
    rule_ids:
      - bank_statement_completion_rule_trans_id_invoice
-
  Now I create a statement. I create statment lines separately because I need
  to find each one by XML id
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement, id: statement_invoice_transactionid_test1}:
    name: Statement with transaction ID
    profile_id: statement_profile_invoice_transactionid
    company_id: base.main_company
-
  I create a statement line for an invoice with transaction ID
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_invoice_transactionid}:
    name: Test autocompletion based on invoice with transaction ID
    statement_id: statement_invoice_transactionid_test1
    transaction_id: XXX77Z
    ref: 6
    date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    amount: 450
-
  I run the auto complete
-
  !python {model: account.bank.statement}: |
    result = self.button_auto_completion(cr, uid, [ref("statement_invoice_transactionid_test1")])
-
  Now I can check that all is nice and shiny, line 1. I expect the invoice has been
  recognised from the transaction ID.
-
  !assert {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_invoice_transactionid, string: Check completion by Invoice transaction ID}:
    - partner_id.name == u'Agrolait'
-
  I verify if the reference of the move has been copied to the statement line
-
  !python {model: account.bank.statement.line}: |
    statement_line = self.browse(cr, uid, ref('statement_line_invoice_transactionid'))
    invoice_obj = self.pool['account.invoice']
    invoice = invoice_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref('invoice_with_transaction_id'))
    reference = invoice.move_id.ref
    assert statement_line.ref == reference
